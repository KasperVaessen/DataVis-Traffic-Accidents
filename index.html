            New York City is very crowded. The honking of car claxons can be heard 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 
            How do the citizens of the Big Apple adapt to the constant stream of traffic? 
            And what is the influence of the measures the government has taken to reduce traffic fatalities? Let's take a deep dive into the data!

                more traffic regulations have been introduced in 2022 to reduce the amount of traffic accidents. So we should expect a drop in certain causes of traffic accidents.

            <p>The prevalence of accidents attributed to "Driver Inattention/Distraction" is a trend comprising nearly half a million incidents. This seems to be the primary reason for most accidents, showcasing the critical role of focused attention while driving. Additionally, "Failure to Yield Right-of-Way" and "Traffic Control Disregarded" appear as substantial contributors to accidents, emphasizing the importance of adherence to traffic rules for road safety.

            <p>There appears to be a fluctuating trend in the number of fatalities from 2013 to 2022. While there are slight variations in specific years, there isn't a clear linear pattern of increase or decrease in fatalities over this time frame. However, the numbers seem to hover around an average range, with occasional spikes in certain years, indicating potential fluctuations in driving conditions, road safety measures, or other contributing factors impacting the fatality count.</p>

            <p>We can see a concentration of collisions during the late afternoon hours, particularly between 16:00 and 18:00. This could indicate that more accidents happen during rush hours when people are commuting back home from work or running errands. Additionally, there's a significant drop in collisions during the early morning hours (between 2:00 and 6:00), possibly due to reduced traffic at those times.</p>

Conversely, Sundays appear to have the lowest collision count among the weekdays and weekends, potentially indicating lighter traffic or different driving behaviors on that day.</p>

            <h1>Accident Trends by Season</h1>
            <p>Analyzing collision data by seasons reveals that summer has the highest number of collisions, totaling over 480,000 incidents. This might be opposite to what you might expect, since winter usually indicates slippery roads. It could be attributed to increased travel during vacation periods, more vehicles on the road for recreational purposes, or potentially more hazardous driving conditions due to heatwaves. On the other hand, winter records the lowest number of collisions, which might be due to more cautious driving. Overall, there might also be more traffic in winter and the pace might be slower.</p>
